# **App Name**: OkapiFlow

## Core Features:

- Space Creation: Allow users to create 'Spaces' representing projects or process areas with a name and visual identifier, and an optional goal to track progress.
- Action Logging: Enable logging actions within Spaces via tappable buttons, including logging multiple units simultaneously using tap and hold gestures. Allow logging of 'Waste' and 'Andon' events with optional comments.
- Data Visualization: Provide visual representations of logged data, including counters for actions, waste, and andon events, and a simple timeline log. Unlockable views can show progress toward goals and filtered logs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral light gray for a clean and unobtrusive background.
- Secondary color: Dark gray for text and key interactive elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) to highlight important actions and progress indicators.
- Minimalist design with clear separation of Spaces and Actions.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different Actions and Spaces.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback on user interactions.

SUBJECT: Project "Okapi" - Gamified Process Improvement Companion - Minimal Plan
DATE: 2025-04-26
PREPARED BY: [Analyst Name Redacted]
OBJECTIVE:
To develop a minimal mobile application ("Okapi") that integrates flexible task tracking with abstracted process improvement concepts (inspired by DMAIC, Lean Waste, Andon) via gamified mechanics and a subtle idle element, fostering user engagement and workflow self-optimization.
BACKGROUND:
Modern work environments present challenges for sustained focus and productivity, particularly impacting neurodivergent individuals but common across the workforce. Traditional process improvement methodologies are effective but often perceived as complex. Idle clicker games demonstrate strong engagement loops through simple interaction, feedback, and passive progression. "Okapi" aims to bridge these by abstracting work and process concepts into a minimal, engaging interface, using gamification to encourage efficient task management and workflow analysis without explicit complex terminology. The "Okapi" mascot provides subtle guidance.
PROPOSED OPERATION: "Okapi" App - Core Design & Mechanics
The application centers around core building blocks, layered with abstracted process concepts and gamification.
 * Core Building Blocks & Abstracted Concepts:
   * Spaces (Abstraction of Process/Project - Define & Control):
     * User-defined containers for related work/tasks.
     * Includes Name, Visual Identifier, and optional Goal/Target (Abstracted CTQ). This goal defines a desired outcome (e.g., Process 50 emails, Complete 1 Report).
     * Status: Active, Paused, Completed (Control point), Archived (Template/Record).
     * Can contain initial Notes (Define Comments).
   * Actions (Abstraction of Work Units/Events - Measure & Improve):
     * User-defined, tappable buttons within a Space representing discrete units of work or events (e.g., Email Processed, Code Commit, Item Sorted, Meeting Attended).
     * Logging (Measure): Tapping logs an entry with Timestamp, Action Type, and associated Space.
     * Multi-Unit Logging: Gesture-based logging for multiple units simultaneously (e.g., Tap & Hold to log 5 emails processed). Quantity logged per Action.
     * Data Points per Log: Timestamp, Action Type, Quantity (default 1), Space, optional Comment (Analyze Context).
     * Predefined Special Actions (Abstracted Improvement/Control Signals):
       * Waste: Button/Tag to log instances of perceived inefficiency (waiting, rework, etc.). Log includes optional Comment for analysis. Supports Analyze/Improve.
       * Andon: Button/Tag to log a problem, blocker, or interruption. Creates distinct log entry, potentially visually flagging the Space. Supports Analyze/Control.
   * Log Entries (Raw Data - Measure & Analyze):
     * Chronological record of all logged Actions, Waste, and Andon events. Basis for understanding workflow.
   * Views (Data Interpretation - Analyze & Control):
     * Visualizations of Log Entries.
     * Default: Counters per Action, Waste, Andon; simple timeline log.
     * Configurable (via unlocks): Progress towards Goal/Target; simple charts (Action counts over time, Waste frequency); Filtered logs (show only Waste). Key for Analyzing performance against Goals and identifying areas for Control adjustments.
 * Gamification & Engagement Layers:
   * Core Loop: Tapping Actions provides immediate, satisfying visual/audio feedback and grants points (mimics clicker mechanic).
   * Points & Efficiency:
     * Actions (per unit) grant base points.
     * Achieving Goals/Targets grants bonus points.
     * Logging Waste may penalize points or an internal "Efficiency Score" for the Space.
     * Addressing Andon (via user interaction/commentary) could positively impact score/points. Focuses rewards on goal achievement and efficiency.
   * Progression & Unlocks:
     * Accumulated points increase User's "Focus Level" or "Insight Level."
     * Leveling unlocks: More custom Action slots, new View types, cosmetic options (Okapi, interface themes), access to slightly deeper, abstracted analysis summaries.
   * Streaks & Achievements: Reward consistent use and specific milestones (e.g., First Goal Met, Logged 1000 Actions, 5 Waste logs analyzed).
   * Minimal Idle Component:
     * While a Space is "Active," passively generates small amounts of "Insight" resource over time.
     * "Insight" is a passive currency spent on non-essential enhancements: Accessing Okapi tips (abstracted process insights), cosmetic unlocks. Designed to provide gentle background progression without demanding constant attention.
   * Okapi Mascot: Subtle, non-intrusive presence. Offers encouragement, celebrates milestones, provides context-sensitive tips based on user data (e.g., high Waste count in a Space triggers a "Perhaps look at interruptions?" hint).
BROAD TERMINOLOGY (User-Facing Abstraction):
 * DMAIC: Unseen/Implied Flow (Define in Space Setup, Measure via Actions/Logs, Analyze via Views/Comments, Improve via Custom Actions/Waste review, Control via Completed Spaces/Goals/Views).
 * CTQ: Goal / Target (in Space setup)
 * Process Area: Space
 * Work Unit / Event: Action
 * Problem Signal: Andon / Alert
 * Inefficiency Log: Waste
 * Notes/Context: Comments (on Logs, Spaces)
 * Data Record: Log / History
 * Charts/Progress: Views
 * Passive Resource: Insight
ASSETS REQUIRED:
 * Design Team: Expertise in minimalist UI/UX, intuitive data visualization, subtle gamification loops, animation, sensory-sensitive design.
 * Development Team: Proficiency in mobile development (iOS/Android), data persistence, smooth interaction/animation implementation, basic data aggregation/analysis.
 * Gamification Consultant: To ensure point systems, progression, and rewards are balanced and genuinely drive desired behaviors.
 * Art & Sound: High-quality, minimalist visual and audio assets for core interactions and Okapi presence.
RISKS:
 * Complexity Creep: Feature layering may compromise minimalist design. Mitigation: Strict adherence to "less is more" principle; make advanced features optional/unlockable.
 * Gamification Misalignment: Game mechanics might distract from or fail to reinforce real-world productivity goals. Mitigation: Directly tie points/rewards to goal achievement, waste reduction, and focused work (via timer integration if added later).
 * Abstraction Ambiguity: Users may not intuitively grasp how game elements relate to process improvement. Mitigation: Clear onboarding, Okapi's context-sensitive guidance, simple naming conventions.
 * Idle Component Irrelevance/Distraction: Idle resource generation may feel pointless or encourage passive checking over active work. Mitigation: Keep idle rewards minor and focused on non-essential enhancements like tips or cosmetics.
RECOMMENDATION:
Proceed to a prototype phase. Focus on implementing the core loop: Space creation with Goal, logging diverse Actions (including multi-unit) with satisfying feedback and points, logging Waste and Andon, and demonstrating simple counter/log Views and basic Leveling. This prototype must validate that abstracted process concepts can be integrated seamlessly and engagingly within a minimalist, gamified, near-idle framework.
